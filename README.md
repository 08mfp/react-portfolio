## Project Overview

My website uses **React** for building dynamic and reusable UI components and **Vite** for its powerful and fast development environment. The site features a clean and modern design, ensuring that visitors have a seamless experience across all screen sizes.

## Key Features

- **Personal Branding**: The website serves as a digital representation of my professional identity, featuring my portfolio, resume, and contact information.

- **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive, ensuring optimal viewing on devices ranging from mobile phones to large desktop screens.

- **ESLint Integration**: The project includes a custom ESLint configuration to maintain code quality and consistency.

## Project Structure

The project is organized in a way that reflects my approach to clean, maintainable code:

- **src/assets**: Contains all static assets such as images, icons, and fonts.
- **src/components**: Reusable components like the navigation bar, footer, and individual portfolio project cards.
- **src/pages**: Pages of the website, including Home, About, Portfolio, and Contact.
- **src/styles**: Custom CSS and style modules for a consistent look and feel across the site.
- **src/utils**: Utility functions that assist with various tasks, such as form validation and API calls.
- **src/App.jsx**: The main application component that ties everything together.
- **src/index.jsx**: The entry point of the application where the React app is rendered.

## Steps to Run the Website Locally

If you wish, you can visit [www.mohfarid.com](http://www.mohfarid.com) to see the website.

Alternatively, follow these steps to set up and run my portfolio website on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/08mfp/react-portfolio.git
cd react-portfolio
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. (Optional) Fix Vulnerabilities

If any vulnerabilities are reported, you can attempt to fix them with:

```bash
npm audit fix
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

To start the website in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- This command will launch a local development server, typically accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- The development server features hot module replacement, allowing you to see changes in real-time as you edit the code.

### 5. View the Website

Open your web browser and navigate to the port provided in the terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). Here, you can see my portfolio website in action.

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy the website, you can build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build in the `dist` directory, ready for deployment to your web host of choice.
